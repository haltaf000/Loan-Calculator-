# Loan-Calculator

This is a testing project used to experiment on while prime project is in development. Main project will be an app and website that uses machine learning and AI to project personal finances, etc... The purpose of this is optimize the data for a consistent performance. 

The project uses Linear Regression, RandomforestClassifier, and Descision Tree Classifier to predict the allocation of loans to people from different walks of life. The models are conpared using three different performance measures - confusion matrix, mean-absolute-error, and accuracy score.

## Installation 

The project uses Python 3.9 and its appropriate libraries including numpy, pandas, spacy, and scikit-learn.

## Purpose

Seek knowledge into aspects of loan allocation to individuals in need. Questions raised before the start of project include what criteria an individual must fulfill to be qualified for a specific amount of loan? Were males tend to recieve more and higher number of loans compared to women? And what predictive models we can build to determine who gets what loan? 

After deliberation, the best models were classifiers. In the instance to test the individual aspect of loan determination to a specific person, linear regression was used.
